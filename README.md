This is a simple bash script that check for the intigreity of the files in a specific directory please note that this project is a proof of concept about how the file integrity can be checked and monitored and it can be improved in many ways like error handling and another method to specify the directory maybe ask the user to provide the absolute path of the directory to prevent any confusion with other directories and the inputs needs to be validated
