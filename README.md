This is a simple bash script that checks the integrity of files in a specific directory. Please note that this project is a proof of concept demonstrating how file integrity can be monitored. It can be improved in multiple ways, such as error handling and implementing another method to specify the directory. For instance, asking the user to provide the absolute path of the directory can prevent any confusion with other directories, and the inputs need to be validated.
